	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<h2>Time complexity, efficient</h2>
	<P>Time Complexity refers to how the runtime of an algorithm grows relative to the input size (n). It helps measure efficiency, especially for large inputs.</P>
	<h2>Space Complexity, O(n)</h2>
	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b>refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size (n).O(n) <b>Space Complexity</b> means memory grows in direct proportion to the input size.
