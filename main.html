    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        <b>Time Complexity</b> refers to how the runtime of an algorithm grows relative to the input size (<i>n</i>). 
        It helps measure efficiency, especially for large inputs.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size (<i>n</i>). 
        An O(n) <b>Space Complexity</b> means memory grows in direct proportion to the input size.
